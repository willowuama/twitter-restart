# twitter-restart

This script is a personal project to reclaim a cluttered twitter account without having to create a new twitter account.

The script was built using the Tweepy api and python.

In order to use the script you'll first need to install Tweepy on your computer and then register the app with your
twitter account in order to get your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, and Access Token Secret.

If you want to be able to Delete Messages (DM's) then you'll need to change your apps permisions to allow DM access
before generating your Keys and Tokens

If you recieve any errors check to make sure you have Tweepy installed and then try regenerating your Keys and Tokens
and replacing them in the Code.
